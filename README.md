## 📖 Narrative

The **Seal's Anytime Sleep Log App** was created to help users quickly track their nightly sleep hours and any important notes about their sleep quality.  
This app was developed for a front-end web development assignment, focusing on loading JSON data, DOM manipulation, and using Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts.

**Development Story:**  
- Started by creating a basic wireframe layout (simple Navbar, Table, and Form).  
- Built out JSON data loading and dynamic rendering to the page using JavaScript and jQuery.  
- Implemented a dummy login modal with Bootstrap 5 modals.  
- Added editing and deleting features for individual sleep log entries.    
- Designed to be mobile-responsive and visually clean with Bootstrap components.
